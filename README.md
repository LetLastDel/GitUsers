The project is created to learn working with CoreData in conjunction with Network Services. Upon launching the application, data is fetched from the API, then saved in CoreData and displayed on the user interface. This allows viewing the already loaded data in case of no network connection. When there is a network connection, the data is overwritten if it differs from what is already stored in CoreData.
